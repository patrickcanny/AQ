# AQ
Implementation of the AQ (A*) Data Mining Algorithm presented in EECS 690

# Overview
The AQ Algorithm is a systematic rule-induction algorithm that creates a cover for each concept in a dataset by calculating and comparing "Stars" generated by analyzing attribute-value pairings in the dataset.

# Program Instructions
# Requirements
- Python 2.7.14
- Enough RAM to survive a massive dataset

# Compilation and Testing
1. Clone this repository into a local directory
2. Type `make run` to  initialize the program. You will be prompted for a fileName, and then again for a MaxStar value. The program will output the rules affiliated with your dataset in the folder `data/my-data.with.negation` and `data/my-data.without.negation`
3. Type Command `make clean` to remove Python-generated machine code, as well as old rulesets.
